About Me
Hello! I'M Pruthviraj Pawar (B.E. Computer Engineer)

My technical expertise includes proficiency in MongoDB and SQLite, which I leverage to build robust and scalable databases. On the front end, I am adept at using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft engaging and responsive web interfaces. Additionally, I utilize Bootstrap and jQuery to enhance the functionality and aesthetics of my projects.

Though I am a fresher, my hands-on experience with full-stack development projects has allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I am continuously learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends to further refine my abilities.

I am enthusiastic about bringing my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to new challenges and opportunities. My goal is to contribute effectively to a dynamic team and grow as a developer in a collaborative environment.
